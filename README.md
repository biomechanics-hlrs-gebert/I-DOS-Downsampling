Downscaling of computed tomography images. For comparison between computing schemes as well as visualization.

## Meta Template
Located in: 
```
./datasets/I-DOS.meta.template
```
For use with previously used data sets:
```
cat ./datasets/I-DOS.meta.template >> Your_Meta_File.meta
```
## Usage
For example for testing on julius:
```
mpirun ./bin/dos_v1.0.0_x86_64 -np 4 <basename>.meta```
```
## Datasets
... are transfered via file exchange and are not pushed into the repository. 
## Requirements
* x86 64bit Hardware
* Linux x86 64Bit Installation with Bash or Zsh
* GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), especially with gfortran
* An installation of Open-MPI
* Geberts libraries. Managed by: ```./manage_geb-lib.sh```

The program must be compiled with:
* Global integer kind=64Bit, signed
* Meta-format integer kind=64Bit, signed
* MPI integer kind=32Bit

The installation of Open MPI is simplified with the install script of the repository "Overview" of the biomechanics-hlrs-gebert organization @GitHub.
### Optional: Gnu debugging
* [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/)
* [tmpi](https://github.com/Azrael3000/tmpi)
* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
## Build
It's tested and therefore recommended to build and run the program as follows.
### Set up the Environment
```vim ./auxiliaries/system_environments/<system>.sh```
```source ./environment.source <system>``` 

* Set an architecture/a system
  * Give the absolute base path of your mpi-installation
  * Alternatively give the proper module names of your compute cluster

### Run make:
Build the program:    ```make```
Create documentation: ```make docs```

### Uninstall:
```make clean && rm -r <your program directory>```
